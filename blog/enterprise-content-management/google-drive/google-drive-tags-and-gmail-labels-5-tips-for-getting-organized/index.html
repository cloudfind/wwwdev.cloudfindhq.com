So here’s a list of other options to help keep on top of your files and folders. A little history first, then scroll down to the<strong> “5 tips to help you organize your Google Drive account”</strong> for practical tips.</p><h2>It all began with Gmail Labels</h2><p>When it first appeared, Gmail presented a new email interface that was really different from what other email clients offered. As a product, Gmail was mainly focused on making email search a central function, on bringing email replies under one parent thread (known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversation_threading" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">conversation threading</a>), and on using what was (and still is) called Gmail “labels” as an alternative to folders.</p><p>Now, if you’re a Gmail user, you probably already know all about the <a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708?hl=en&amp;rd=1" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gmail labels</a> feature. But for those of you who don’t know it, Gmail “labels” or “tags” replace conventional folders and provide a flexible way of organizing emails by topics. You can apply several topics or subjects to a certain email thread to classify it.</p><p>People enjoy using Gmail labels because they make it easier for them to sort and organize their inboxes according to the topics that they care about, instead of just the default ones that Google provides (Primary, Social, Promotions, Updates and Forums). And did I mention you can also color-code them?</p><p>For example, I use Gmail labels to categorize emails containing important attachments by topics like expenses, invoices and receipts.</p><h2>And then Google Drive came along (without tags…)</h2><p>When Google Drive was launched in <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2012</a>, offering Gmail users an astonishing 15GB of free storage space, everyone (or almost everyone) was amazed at the offer. This was mainly because Google Drive’s 15GB offer greatly overshadowed the 2GB that Dropbox was offering at the time. Still, Google Drive being launched without a minimal file tagging functionality was like having a guest arrive late at the party and without bringing any beer or wine.</p><p>In <a href="http://thenextweb.com/google/2014/10/01/google-announces-10-price-cut-compute-engine-instances-google-drive-passed-240m-active-users/" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Oct 2014,</a> there were over <strong>240 million active users</strong> on Google Drive, both consumer and enterprise. And Google Drive as a platform is certainly growing at a fast rate. The number of apps that you can add to your Google Drive account is already in the hundreds as can be seen by searching for them in the<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/apps?_feature=drive" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chrome Web Store</a> (see picture).</p><p>So all of this is great, but why are we being forced to rely solely on conventional folders to organize our files by? It does seem a bit outdated and inflexible, doesn’t it? And more importantly, why don’t we have Google Drive Tags or Google Drive Labels yet? After all, Gmail has them… and the consistency I’m used to seeing in Google’s products makes me expect labels or tags in Google Drive as well.</p><p>And since we’re talking about consistency across a product range, <a href="https://support.google.com/keep/answer/6191044?hl=en-GB" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google Keep</a> just received an update that includes the ability to add labels to notes. That’s great! But Google Keep was launchedafter Google Drive and it has way fewer users than Google Drive has. What gives, Google?</p><h2>Google Drive Tags and Labels – are we there yet?</h2><p>Google Drive tags and/or labels have been requested by a lot of people and this can be seen from the multiple discussion threads that people opened on the Google Drive <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topicsearchin/drive/google$20drive$20tags" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Help Forum</a>.</p><p>People want Google Drive tags because tagging files and Google Docs is an easy way to stay organized, making sure you can easily find the files later. Tags are simply a much more flexible way of organizing files (and of finding them) than just using traditional folders. Plus, we’re already used to doing it with Gmail labels/tags, so it makes sense to have the same type of functionality in Google Drive as well.</p><p>And it’s not just Gmail that has labels/tags. There are a lot of other apps and services out there that provide tagging as a functionality – <a href="https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/201011613-Tagging-Content-in-Box" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Box</a>, <a href="https://evernote.com/contact/support/kb/#!/article/28452448" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Evernote</a>, <a href="http://help.getpocket.com/customer/portal/articles/332535-tagging-in-pocket-on-your-computer" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pocket</a> and <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202754" class="external" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OS X</a> just to name a few of them.</p><p>Even if the wider market seems to have adopted tags as a better way to manage information, a native feature that enables Google Drive tags seems like a distant dream so far. You can use third-party apps that enable tags in Google Drive, though, and <a href="/">Cloudfind</a> enables both manual and automatic file tagging in Google Drive.</p><p>A standard native solution from Google might become a reality in the future, but up until now (June 2015) there haven’t been any rumors or signaling from Google Drive product managers that they’re even entertaining the thought. We’ll just have to wait and see.</p><p>Either way, the market is already far ahead using technologies like machine learning and recommendation engines to suggest relevant tags to the users, together with patented algorithms that enable automatic tagging (like Cloudfind does).</p><h2>5 Tips to help you organize your Google Drive account</h2><p>I’ve put together a short list of available workarounds that the cloud storage connoisseurs will see as a poor substitute for actual Google Drive tags that could be freely applied to files and folders. But until the mythical Google Drive tags feature gets built (if it ever gets built), these workarounds are sure better than nothing.</p><h3>1. Use the Description field</h3><p>All files and folders in Google Drive have a <strong>Description</strong> field under the Details section. You can type in keywords, phrases or any type of metadata inside the Description field and all of the content you put in there will be indexed by Google, making it searchable.</p><p>You can use this Description field as a substitute to having proper Google Drive tags, by typing in the key topics/keywords you want to associate with a particular file or folder. The current functionality doesn’t allow you to bulk edit this field for multiple files or folders, but at least there is no apparent character limit.</p><h3>2. Add a Star to a file or a folder</h3><p>You can add a star to your favorite files and folders. This makes them visually stand out (see picture below) and also allows for a slightly more enhanced Google Drive search functionality by enabling a new filter called <strong>is:starred</strong>. Adding this filter to your queries will constrain your search to only bring up starred items.</p><p>Right-click on any file or folder to add a star. You can also access all of your starred items by clicking on the <strong>Starred</strong> button.</p>3. Add the same file to multiple folders, without having to duplicate it<p>You can have the same file live under multiple folders, without copying or moving it. It’s like creating a mirror reference to the original file, one that you can move wherever you want (like a shortcut). The caveat is that if you delete any instance of that file, either the original or one of its references, all of the items get deleted (moved to Trash).</p><p>Here’s how it works on both Windows and OS X.</p><p>Select a file (or a couple of them) and press SHIFT+Z to get this modal window:</p><p>Browse to the folder where you’d like to have a shortcut/reference of the file you selected and then click <strong>Add.</strong></p><p>And you’re done!</p><p>You have neither copied nor moved the file to that folder, you’ve merely created a reference to it that sits inside the second folder. The file should now be available in both folders (and several other folders if you repeated the process).</p><p>Here is the file I used in the example above. The document is entitled “My shiny new document” and you can see it living under two different folders, one called <strong>Rob</strong> and another one called <strong>Customer</strong><strong>related</strong>.</p><p>It’s not clear to me why Google Drive would have this feature that behaves so much like Gmail labels, yet is 10x more difficult to use efficiently, but there you have it!</p><h3>4. Change the color of a folder</h3><p>And last, but not least, you can color-code your folders! It’s not a substitute for actually having Google Drive tags, but if you can assign a specific meaning to a color, you can use it to slightly improve how you organize your folders.</p><p>As an example, let’s say Green is the color for any customer-related projects. Then all the folders related to such an activity should be colored Green.</p><p>You can change the color of a folder by selecting it and then clicking on the Change color option. This will reveal a palette containing 24 colors that you can choose from.</p><p>I know all of the above substitutes are far from perfect, but for those who insist on staying exclusively within the Google environment, that’s as far as it goes.</p><h3>5. Automatic tagging using Cloudfind</h3><p>Automatic tagging of files is becoming increasingly important. The rate at which new files are being uploaded to the cloud makes manual curation unrealistic and unreliable. This is especially true for teams and organizations that use Google Drive as the basis for collaboration. It’s one thing to send someone a link to a file that you’re both working on right now, but it’s another entirely to expect a new team member to get a handle quickly on years of accumulated files and folders. Automated tagging can solve that problem, giving knowledge workers a whole new way to interact with their information.</p><p>Cloudfind automates the tagging and classifying process using cutting-edge algorithms. The automated tagging of files eliminates inefficiency, reducing confusion and time spent searching for relevant information – without adding to admin overhead. And in the end, isn’t that what moving to the cloud is all about?</p><p>By connecting Cloudfind to your Google Drive account, you’ll be able to see your files and folders from a completely new, intuitive perspective – fully tagged, automatically.</p><h2>The Traditional Methods – Folders, File Naming Conventions and Sharing Strategies</h2><p>And if you’re looking for alternatives, then Dropbox is the most popular cloud document management tool out there so you might want to consider it. Just make sure you know how it fares against Google Drive.</p><h2>Find files faster and be more efficient.</h2><p>Cloudfind works with Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive.</p><p style="text-align: center"><a href="https://app.cloudfindhq.com/" class="button button--teal" title="Try for free">Try for free</a></p></div></div></div><footer><div class="container"><div class="columns"><div class="column">&copy; Cloudfind Ltd, 2018</div><div class="column is-half footer-links"><ul><li><a href="/pricing/">Pricing</a></li><li><a href="/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="/terms-of-use/">Terms of Use</a></li><li><a href="/contact/">Contact</a></li></ul></div><div class="column"></div></div></div></footer><!-- Google Tag Manager (noscript) --><noscript><iframe src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/ns.html?id=GTM-WQZGZJ" height="0" width="0" style="display:none;visibility:hidden"></iframe></noscript><!-- End Google Tag Manager (noscript) --><!-- Intercom Widget --><script data-cfasync="false">window.intercomSettings = { "app_id": "ew4x68i8" };</script><script data-cfasync="false">(function () { var w = window; var ic = w.Intercom; if (typeof ic === "function") { ic('reattach_activator'); ic('update', intercomSettings); } else { var d = document; var i = function () { i.c(arguments) }; i.q = []; i.c = function (args) { i.q.push(args) }; w.Intercom = i; function l() { var s = d.createElement('script'); s.type = 'text/javascript'; s.async = true; s.src = 'https://widget.intercom.io/widget/ew4x68i8'; var x = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0]; x.parentNode.insertBefore(s, x); } if (w.attachEvent) { w.attachEvent('onload', l); } else { w.addEventListener('load', l, false); } } })()</script><!-- End Intercom Widget --></body></html>
